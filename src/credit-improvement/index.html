                        Paying off a collection may initially lower your score
                        because it updates the account status. However, this is
                        temporary and your score will improve over time as the
                        account ages and shows positive payment history.

                        Credit improvement is a gradual process. You may see
                        some improvements within 3-6 months, but significant
                        changes typically take 12-24 months of consistent
                        positive behavior.

                        Generally, no. Keep old accounts open unless they have
                        annual fees. Closing accounts can reduce your available
                        credit and shorten your credit history, both of which
                        can lower your score.
